# ``BbAppState``

Global application state management.

## Overview

The BbAppState library provides an observable state container for global application state. It manages authentication provider registrations, network connectivity status, loading states, error conditions, and content loading status. This centralized state management enables coordinated UI updates across the entire application and provides a single source of truth for application-wide state.
